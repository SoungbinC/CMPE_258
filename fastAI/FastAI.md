# Fast.AI Deep Learning Tasks in Colab

This Colab notebook is designed to demonstrate the application of the fast.ai library in executing several deep learning tasks. We will explore four distinct tasks: object detection and segmentation in images, a tabular data task, and a recommendation system. For each task, we will cover the dataset preparation, model training, inference, and evaluation of results metrics.

## Vision Object Detection Task

### Dataset Preparation

-   Description of the dataset used for object detection.
-   Steps for data loading and preprocessing using fast.ai.

### Model Training

-   Selection of the model architecture suitable for object detection.
-   Training process description including loss function, optimizer, and any hyperparameter tuning.

### Inference and Evaluation

-   Performing inference on test data.
-   Evaluation metrics (e.g., mAP, precision, recall) to measure model performance.

## Vision Segmentation Task

### Dataset Preparation

-   Details of the image segmentation dataset.
-   Data loading and augmentation techniques employed.

### Model Training

-   Choice of segmentation model architecture.
-   Training details including loss functions, optimizer choices, and hyperparameter settings.

### Inference and Evaluation

-   Inference steps on unseen data.
-   Metrics to evaluate the segmentation performance (e.g., IoU, Dice coefficient).

## Tabular Task

### Dataset Overview

-   Description of the tabular dataset.
-   Preprocessing steps for tabular data.

### Model Training

-   Model selection for tabular data.
-   Description of the training process, including loss function and optimization strategy.

### Evaluation

-   Explanation of the inference process on tabular data.
-   Metrics used to evaluate model performance (e.g., accuracy, RMSE).

## Recommendation Task

### Dataset Information

-   Overview of the dataset used for building the recommendation system.
-   Data preprocessing and feature engineering steps.

### Model Training

-   Selection of the recommendation model architecture.
-   Details on the training approach, including the choice of loss function and optimizer.

### Inference and Evaluation

-   Process of generating recommendations.
-   Metrics to assess the recommendation system's performance (e.g., precision@k, recall@k).

## Conclusion

-   Summary of the key findings from each task.
-   Discussion on the performance of the models and potential areas for improvement.
